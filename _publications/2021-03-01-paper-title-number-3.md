title: "SketRet: Bi-Level Domain Adaptation for Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-03-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'The efficacy of zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) models is governed by two challenges. The immense distributions-gap between the sketches and the images requires a proper domain alignment. Moreover, the fine-grained nature of the task and the high intra-class variance of many categories necessitates a class-wise discriminative mapping among the sketch, image, and the semantic spaces. Under this premise, we propose BDA-SketRet, a novel ZS-SBIR framework performing a bi-level domain adaptation for aligning the spatial and semantic features of the visual data pairs progressively.'
