The limitations of domain dependence in neural networks and data scarcity are addressed in this paper by analyzing the problem of semi-supervised medical image classification across multiple visual domains using a single integrated framework. Under this premise, we learn a universal parametric family of neural networks, which share a majority of their weights across domains by learning a few adaptive domain-specific parameters.
