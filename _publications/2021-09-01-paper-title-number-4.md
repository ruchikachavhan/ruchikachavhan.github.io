We tackle the novel problem of incremental unsupervised domain adaptation (IDA) in this paper. We assume that a labeled source domain and different unlabeled target domains are incrementally observed with the constraint that data corresponding to the current domain is only available at a time. The goal is to preserve the accuracies for all the past domains while generalizing well for the current domain. We propose a novel framework called Feature Replay based Incremental Domain Adaptation (FRIDA) which leverages a new incremental generative adversarial network (GAN) called domain-generic auxiliary classification GAN (DGAC-GAN) for producing domain-specific feature representations seamlessly.
