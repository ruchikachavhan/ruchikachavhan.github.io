excerpt: 'We deal with the problem of high inter-class similarity in reference sentences describing remote sensing data in optical remote sensing (RS) images using the notion of deep reinforcement learning. To this end, we introduce an Actor Dual-Critic training strategy where a second critic model is deployed in the form of an encoder-decoder RNN to encode the latent information corresponding to the original and generated captions. Our proposed encoder-decoder RNN guarantees high-level comprehension of images by sentence-to-image translation.'
