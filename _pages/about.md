I am an incoming PhD student at the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I will be supervised by Prof. Timothy Hospedales. My research is funded by the [Samsung AI Research Centre Cambridge](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_cambridge). My research interests are mainly centered around computer vision and machine learning spanning multi-task learning, meta learning, reinforcement learning, and domain adaptation.


I recently completed my bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics at [Indian Institute of Technology](https://www.iitb.ac.in) where I was advised by Prof. [Biplab Banerjee](https://biplab-banerjee.github.io/) and Prof. [Subhasis Chaudhuri](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/main/main.html). I was also a summer intern at Sony Corporation, Tokyo where I worked on real-time image compression using deep learning techniques. 


Apart from academics, I enjoy yoga, running, weight-lifting, or reading novels in my leisure time.


Please have a look at my CV for more details on my academic front. I maintain a list of my publications and research  under the Research tab.
